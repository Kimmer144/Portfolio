            <p>A mock magazine featuring traditional games. This was a special edition devoted to playing cards.</p>

            <p>The entire piece was created using Adobe&reg; Photoshop&reg; software. This piece was a college project for the class Image Editing in Photoshop&reg;. I wanted the layout to mimic a traditional face playing card. 
                I created the playing card dress and crown in 2018, as part of my <a href="../../halloween.html">Alice in Wonderland Halloween</a> theme.</p>
